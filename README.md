# gw2 (gateway-finder2)
## A python3 rewrite of pentestmonkey's gateway-finder

A less functional (for now) rewrite of pentestmonkey's tool:
* https://github.com/pentestmonkey/gateway-finder

This version takes IP address input instead of MAC address, realistically it doesn't make much difference.

It should be fairly self explanatory. The code is still a little scruffy!
